# Alphabet Converter

Alphabet Converter is a script that converts letters from one language to another.
Good way to learn some new language's alphabet, because text, that you read,
is still on your native language, but it is written with another languages letters.

## Setup

* Clone this repository  to your local storage.
    ```commandline
    git clone https://github.com/otanadzetsotne/alphabet_converter
    ```
* From repository folder install all requirements
  to your local Python virtual environment.
  ```commandline
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
* Add to [dictionaries](./dictionaries/) folder new JSON file with your
  alphabet translations (just Russian to Georgian yet).
  ```json
  {
  "А": "ა",
  "а": "ა",
  "Б": "ბ",
  "б": "ბ",
  ...
  "Дз": "ძ",
  "дз": "ძ"
  }
  ```
  
## Using

Run commands from your shell.

* You could convert plain text.

```commandline
python app.py convert ru_ge 'Some text to convert'
```

* And you could convert utf-8 encoded text files, giving path to file and 
path to new file with converted text, that will be created automatically.

```commandline
python app.py convert_file ru_ge path_to_file.txt path_to_converted.txt
```
